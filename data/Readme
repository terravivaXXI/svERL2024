Data for this article comes from different sources:

It can all be downloaded directly from a google drive directory hosted in the account of the first author:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aHQ1cNApS6PSCANcNAJb42adefRdwr5r?usp=sharing

All data in the directory _pop_ was downloaded from the webpage of the **Sistema Nacional de Informacion Municipal** 
that can be accessed through [INAFED](http://www.snim.rami.gob.mx/snim1.html) portal under the
tab _Descarga de Base de Datos_. This website has a large collection of datasets in the topics of 
Population, Housing, Economy, Marginalization, Indigenous Languages and others.

Data in CONABIO directory was directly downloaded from [CONABIO website](http://www.conabio.gob.mx/informacion/gis/?vns=gis_root/region/biotic/spr_gw) using the 
_Portal de Geoinformacion 2022_ where you can select the dataset that will be overlaid
on the actual map of Mexico. To download the data, go to the ribbon immediately above the map
and click "Descargar Tema", which will automatically download the .zip file to your machine.

Metadata for elections is included as a separate file within the directory _elections_ as
there are many considerations that have to be kept in mind to process the information.

All files within the *Mun_agg_INEGI_census* in the directory *inegi_microdatos_lab* were transfered 
to me via FTP by the office of Microdatos, as they have the most user friendly formats for the 
census aggregates that cannot be uploaded to the website as they are too big. 

Files in *inegi_website* were downloaded directly from the [INEGI website]():
- [Catalogo de Localidades](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/ageeml/)
- [Indicadores Municipales](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/scitel/Default?ev=9). As the
ITER system only allows user to download data state by state, I wrote directly to the
system manager and they provided me with the municipality aggregates via e-mail
- [Panorama Sociodemografico de Mexico](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/ccpv/2020/tableros/panorama/) is
a new product that condenses the most relevant indicators from ITER in one spreadsheet 
curated for a simpler read. Given that I have the Indicadores Municipales, there is no 
actual need of this DB but I thought it would be of help to have it with its clean format.
- [ENAS](https://www.inegi.org.mx/datosabiertos/) were dowloaded in bulk and do not
have a helpful structure for analysis
- *LM-2071...* contains all field descriptors for INEGI census, and is helpful for 
designing algorithms but does not contain actual data.

Files in *procampo* were downloaded using a python script from the webpage [Subsidios al Campo](http://subsidiosalcampo.org.mx/)
the script can be found in AgCensusMx project.

Sembrando Vida info has been downloaded from the webpage of the [Padron Unico de Beneficiarios](https://pub.bienestar.gob.mx/pub/programasIntegrales) by clicking the 
program name, selecting the desired period and then selecting any state + obtener to 
unlock a box in the upper right hand that will offer a download of the enrollment 
list and payments for that month. The links to the download are stored in the file 
_urls_for_download_ in _data/processed_ and the script *sv/PadronSV_downloader* will 
fetch the data and store it in _data/temp_

Spatial data was downloaded directly from INEGI website, there are specific locations for
each topic [Continuo Nacional de Vegetacion](https://www.inegi.org.mx/temas/usosuelo/#Descargas) and
[Marco Geoestadistico](https://www.inegi.org.mx/temas/mg/#Descargas)

All "SV_" files were derived from the SV enrollment lists downloaded from 
the government webpage.

Forest cover data was processed with Earth Engine and downloaded as csvs on 
a municipality resolution. 

Biodiversity indexes were derived from CONABIO's priority maps available 
on the website. A post processing was done to allocate each municipality 
a value ranging from 0 to 3 depending on the proportion of its land 
characterized as prioritary. 

Indice de Rezago Social data is produced by CONAPO and is accessible through government 
open data portal.

MGN december 2021 is from INEGI downloaded directly from the website and from
which only the municipality shapefiles were retained
