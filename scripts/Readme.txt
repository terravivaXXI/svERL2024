All scripts are rooted at the top of the following branching directory:
sfm
- paper1
-- datP1
-- scrP1
-- ploP1

If attempting to reproduce the workflow, please:
- download and host the data at sfm/paper1/datP1
- download and host scripts at sfm/paper1/ploP1

This inconvenience is a consequence of the fact that github does not host datasets that are larger than 25MB, which turns out to be the case for most of our data files
